Welcome to my Personal Website/Blog's code!
This is small side project I'm writing in Rails/Javascript, and primarily serves three functions/purposes:

1. Serve as a platform where I can share my scholarly and artistic exploits
2. Refresh myself on Ruby, Rails, Automation Tools like Cucumber/Capybara/Rspec, and SaaS principles in general
3. Solidify my knowledge in JS

Currently, I am using:
* Ruby v.2.5.0
* Bootstrap
* Cucumber, Capybara, and RSpec
* Travis CI for integration testing
* Snyk for security validation

I will include more documentation as I continue through this project (primarily for myself) such as:

* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions

_(Note on the title)_
_Blue is my favorite color, and Corundum is the name of the mineral that **rubies** are comprised of -- a fitting title for this blog application that I'm writing for myself in Rails._
_I have always been a huge fan of rocks and minerals, and enjoy collecting new specimens in my free time._
_Unfortunately, sapphires are blue corundum -- not rubies._
