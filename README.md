Note on the title:
Blue is my favorite color, and Corundum is the name of the mineral that makes _Rubies_ -- a fitting title for this blog application that I'm writing for myself in Rails.
Unfortunately, sapphires are blue corundum, so the similarities die there.

This project serves two purposes:

1. Serve as a platform where I can share my scholarly and artistic exploits
2. Refresh myself on Ruby, Rails, Automation Tools like Cucumber/Capybara/Rspec, and SaaS principles in general

Currently, I am using:
* Ruby v.2.5.0
* Cucumber, Capybara, and RSpec for testing
* Travis CI for integration testing
* Snyk for security validation

Will include more documentation as I continue through this project (primarily for myself) such as:

* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
